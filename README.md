# 🚀 Deployment Status API (Node.js + Axios)

This project demonstrates the use of Node.js's built-in `http` module to build a simple REST API, and `axios` to consume that API. It simulates a real-world DevOps scenario where microservice deployment statuses are tracked and fetched.

---

## 📦 Features

- Simple HTTP server using Node.js `http` module
- REST endpoint to check deployment status of services
- Axios-based client to poll service status (like a DevOps dashboard)
- Real-world use case: status monitoring for microservices in CI/CD
