# 🚀 JavaScript Async Styles: Callback vs Promise vs Async/Await

This project demonstrates three common ways to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript:

- 📌 Callback Style (Nested functions)
- 📌 Promise Style (Chained `.then()`)
- 📌 Async/Await Style (Modern and readable)

# 🌦️ JavaScript CLI Tools – Weather App & To-Do App

Welcome to my Day 2 project for the #10DaysOfJavaScript series!  
This repository contains two simple but practical **command-line tools** built using **Node.js**:

- ✅ Real-Time **Weather App**
- ✅ File-based **To-Do App**

Day3
# 🚀 Deployment Status API (Node.js + Axios)

This project demonstrates the use of Node.js's built-in `http` module to build a simple REST API, and `axios` to consume that API. It simulates a real-world DevOps scenario where microservice deployment statuses are tracked and fetched.

---

## 📦 Features

- Simple HTTP server using Node.js `http` module
- REST endpoint to check deployment status of services
- Axios-based client to poll service status (like a DevOps dashboard)
- Real-world use case: status monitoring for microservices in CI/CD

Day6

# 🛡️ JWT Authentication API using Express, Bcrypt, and JSON Web Tokens

This project is a simple **Node.js + Express.js API** that implements user **registration**, **login**, and access to a **protected route** using:

- `bcrypt`: For securely hashing passwords
- `jsonwebtoken`: For generating and verifying JWT tokens
- `dotenv`: To store environment variables (like secret keys)

---

## 🚀 Features

- Register a user and securely hash their password using `bcrypt`
- Login and generate a signed JWT token
- Protect routes using JWT authentication middleware
- Store JWT secret in `.env` for security

---

## 📦 Dependencies

- `express`
- `bcrypt`
- `jsonwebtoken`
- `dotenv`

Install with:

```bash
npm install express bcrypt jsonwebtoken dotenv
